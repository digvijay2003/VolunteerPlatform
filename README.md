# Feedhope

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Feedhope** is a humanitarian platform that connects individuals in need of food or essential supplies with generous donors who want to make a difference. It enables real-time visibility into requests from underprivileged communities and allows users to contribute directly by fulfilling those needs.

The mission of FEEDhope is to bridge the gap between abundance and scarcity through technology, transparency, and community participation.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Create a Request**: A person in need (or an NGO on their behalf) creates a request with details and optional photos.
2. **Verification**: Requests are verified manually or via trusted NGO partners.
3. **Discover & Donate**: Donors explore live requests and choose to fulfill them either in-person or via third-party delivery.
4. **Track & Confirm**: Both parties receive updates, and a proof-of-delivery mechanism ensures transparency.
