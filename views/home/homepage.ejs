      <p>India is a country of rich heritage with abundant culture, flavors, and cuisines. Yet it is grappling with a
        serious issue that impacts nearly 23 crore people living in the country – Food Wastage in India. The Ministry of
        Agriculture, India reported that nearly 50,000 INR crores worth of food gets wasted each year.</p>
      <p>This alarming amount of food that is getting wasted every single day in a country where millions of people
        still go to bed hungry each night is an appalling reality that demands our immediate attention and action. Come

              Believe it or not, a large quantity of food gets wasted even before it reaches the consumer’s plate. Right
              after harvest, the food commodities begin to deteriorate in quality if they are not handled properly. This
              includes poor transportation facilities, overloading in warehouses, the warehouses being maintained very
              poorly and finally improper handling during distribution.

              Be it eating from restaurants or at home, most people think it is okay to waste food because they have
              paid for it. Of course, the restaurants or vendors will not be facing any loss as they are charging us,
              consumers, for the same, but the real cost is to the economy and the planet. The food that was wasted
              because we couldn’t priorly plan if we could consume it or not; would land in the trash, thus not being of
              any use to anybody.

              India is famously known for its ultra-grand weddings throwing extravagance wherever possible but what it
              is not known for is that it is one of the leading causes of food wastage. Enormous amounts of food go to
              waste during such occasions. According to research, about 40% of the food prepared goes to waste and is
              simply thrown away after the wedding ends.

              One of the most problematic causes of food wastage these days is the usage of edible foods in markets such
              as Cosmetics, Healthcare etc., When the foods do not comply to the standards set by these markets they
              would straight up get rejected although they are perfectly edible. This is a grave mistake that would cost
              the economy largely.

              The leading consequence of food wastage on the country is its direct contribution to malnutrition and
              starvation. According to a report released by Feeding India, around 194.4 million people or 14.3% of the

              Food waste in India is not just a national issue; it also affects the planet on a large scale as food is a
              universal commodity and is not just restricted to people of a particular country. The environmental
              hazards associated with the wastage are also immense resulting in the emission of unnecessary carbon that
              could result in a devastating note.

              In India, 40% of the food wasted is equivalent to nearly 92,000 crore/year. This is equivalent to nearly
              1% of the GDP which is depleted in the form of food wastage in India. Each person in India wastes 55 kg of
              food per year as per <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021"
                target="_blank">UN Environment Programme’s report</a>. What might look like a harmless wastage of food
              deeply impacts the agricultural sector and affects the nation’s economy. We also need to keep in mind that
              it is not just the food that is getting wasted but also all the resources such as water, land, energy and
              most importantly the hard labour of the farmers and all the people involved in the production of food.
              This is the food wastage statistics in India..
