        <h2 class="section-title">Welcome to FeedHope!</h2>
        <p>FeedHope is a community-driven initiative aimed at combating hunger and reducing food waste. Our mission is to ensure no one goes to bed hungry, and that surplus food is redirected to those who need it most. Founded on compassion, sustainability, and social responsibility, FeedHope envisions a world where food nourishes people, not wasted.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is twofold, addressing the root causes of hunger and food waste:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alleviate Hunger:</strong> We provide nutritious meals to individuals and families experiencing food insecurity, using innovative and effective distribution models. Our goal is to ensure reliable access to healthy food for those in need.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce Food Waste:</strong> We rescue surplus food from various sources—including donors, businesses, and communities—and redirect it to those in need, helping to reduce waste and protect the environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We envision a future where food insecurity is eradicated, and food waste is a thing of the past. Our aspiration is to foster a global movement where communities unite to share resources, support each other, and build sustainable solutions for a brighter tomorrow. Together, we aim to ensure that no food is wasted and no one goes hungry.</p>
